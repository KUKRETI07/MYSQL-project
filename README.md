# Retail Store Sales Analysis

Overview

This project focuses on analyzing a retail store's performance using pure SQL. It involves multiple interlinked datasets (products, sales, customers, orders, etc.), and answers real business questions through joins, filtering, aggregation, subqueries, and more. 
The goal was to generate valuable insights into customer behavior, product performance, and overall sales trends.

# Problem Statement:

The goal of this project is to analyze retail store data using SQL and extract meaningful insights that can help improve sales, marketing, and customer engagement. The dataset includes multiple relational tables like customers, products, orders, and transactions.

# Tools & Technologies

Database: MySQL

Interface: MySQL Workbench / phpMyAdmin / DBeaver

Techniques Used:

 * JOINs (INNER, LEFT)

 * GROUP BY, HAVING, ORDER BY
   
 * Aggregates (SUM, AVG, COUNT, etc.)

#  Business Questions Answered

 * Top 5 most sold products by quantity

 * Total sales revenue across all time

 * Average selling price and quantity sold per product

 * Monthly and yearly sales trends

 * Highest revenue-generating customers

 * Category-wise revenue and product performance

 * Repeat vs one-time customers

# Key Insights

 * roduct categories with higher prices don’t always generate the most revenue — volume is key

 * 10% of customers contribute to 60% of revenue (classic Pareto insight)

 * Certain months (e.g., festive seasons) show sales spikes — seasonal planning is critical

# Goals

 * Practice real-world SQL across multiple tables

 * Strengthen JOIN logic and business understanding

 * Apply advanced SQL for data storytelling and analytics
